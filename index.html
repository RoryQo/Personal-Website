        <h2>PROJECTS</h2>
        <h3>Tuition Variation Model, Undergraduate Research Capstone</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Developed a predictive model in R to analyze tuition rates for public and private four-year universities in the U.S., utilizing institutional, quality of life, and crime metrics to explain tuition variability.</li>
            <li>Achieved over 85% of variability in tuition rates accounted for, with national ranking identified as the most significant predictor, demonstrating that prestigious institutions leverage their rankings to charge higher tuition.</li>
            <li>Collected data from three public datasets encompassing 60 observations from top U.S. universities, including metrics such as institutional control, national rank, and median income.</li>
            <li>Constructed a comprehensive linear regression model, employing leave-one-out cross-validation (LOOCV) to validate predictive capabilities and ensuring robustness against overfitting.</li>
            <li>Conducted thorough data wrangling to clean and prepare datasets, addressing missing values and ensuring appropriate variable encoding.</li>
            <li>Applied the model to the University of Pittsburgh, revealing that out-of-state students pay approximately $9,000 above expected tuition, highlighting the model's practical applicability for prospective students assessing educational investments.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>CPI Mini Research Capstone</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Created a custom CPI calculation for college students, analyzing essential products.</li>
            <li>Collected price data across three U.S. regions over five years.</li>
            <li>Visualized inflation rates of the custom CPI against general CPI trends.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Age Correlation in Married Couples, Bayesian Analysis Project</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Analyzed the relationship between the ages of husbands and wives using data from 100 sampled U.S. married couples, aiming to hypothesize a semiconjugate prior.</li>
            <li>Generated predictive datasets through random sampling from established distributions, confirming a strong positive correlation between the ages.</li>
            <li>Employed Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods to estimate mean ages and the correlation coefficient, creating new confidence intervals for both.</li>
            <li>Demonstrated that the Bayesian approach provided narrower confidence intervals for average ages, reducing them by over a year compared to frequentist methods.</li>
            <li>Highlighted the advantages of Bayesian methods in estimating correlations, achieving a 2% reduction in the correlation coefficient's confidence interval.</li>
            <li>Utilized R for data analysis, focusing on visualizing relationships and employing statistical techniques to enhance the reliability of findings on age dynamics in marriages.</li>
        </ul>

            <li>Achieved approximately 93% accuracy in predicting adaptability using advanced machine learning models, including non-linear Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Random Forest, outperforming basic models like Naive Bayes.</li>
            <li>Identified significant factors influencing adaptability, such as age, class duration, gender, and education level, while finding device type and load-shedding to be less influential.</li>
            <li>Created insightful visualizations using Python libraries to analyze distributions and relationships among demographic factors, enhancing understanding of student adaptability.</li>
