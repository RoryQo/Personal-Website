        <p>Hello! Iâ€™m Rory Quinlan, a passionate graduate student pursuing a Master of Science in Quantitative Economics at the University of Pittsburgh. With a strong foundation in statistics and economics, I thrive on transforming complex data into actionable insights.</p>
        
        <p>Throughout my academic journey, I have been actively involved in various projects and research initiatives that have honed my analytical skills and deepened my understanding of economic trends. I enjoy tackling real-world problems, whether itâ€™s analyzing survey data to improve financial literacy or developing predictive models for educational outcomes.</p>
        
        <p>In addition to my academic pursuits, I have experience as a Peer Financial Educator and an Undergraduate Research Assistant, where I collaborated with teams to deliver impactful workshops and conduct thorough analyses. I am dedicated to helping others navigate their financial journeys and empowering them with knowledge.</p>
        
        <p>When Iâ€™m not immersed in data, you can find me exploring new technologies, engaging in community service, or hiking the beautiful trails around Pittsburgh. I believe in continuous learning and am always looking for opportunities to expand my skill set and make a difference.</p>
        
        <p>Feel free to connect with me through my <a href="https://github.com/Roryqo">GitHub</a> or <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/rory-quinlan">LinkedIn</a> profiles. I look forward to connecting!</p>
