        <h2>PROJECTS</h2>
        <h3>Tuition Variation Model, Undergraduate Research Capstone</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Model market value for a college given key predictors, determining if a college is over or underpriced compared to market value, allowing maximization of return on investment</li>
            <li>Applied linear regression analysis (model creation, selection, and validation) in R to achieve an adjusted coefficient of determination value of 87% for tuition variation in the education market</li>
            <li>Employed leave-one-out cross-validation (LOOCV) to validate model performance, maintaining an R-squared value of 0.85, demonstrating robustness and minimal overfitting</li>
        </ul>

       <h3>CPI Mini Research Project</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Analyzed the Consumer Price Index (CPI) specifically for college students by evaluating essential products and services they typically consume, resulting in a custom CPI calculation based on selected items and their respective weights across different U.S. regions</li>
        <li>Conducted a comprehensive analysis highlighting that while the custom CPI is less robust than the general CPI, it captures inflation trends that significantly affect college students, particularly for essential items like gas, recreation, and rent</li>
        <li>Developed a comparative graph visualizing inflation rates of the custom CPI against the general CPI over various lag periods, emphasizing the differing experiences of college students compared to the broader population</li>
        <li>Collected price data through API retrieval for three regions (Northeast, Midwest, South) covering a five-year period (January 2017 to January 2022) to support the CPI calculations</li>
        <li>Implemented functions to calculate inflation rates based on the custom CPI, facilitating insights into the sensitivity of student-related expenses to inflation changes</li>
    </ul>

        
        <h3>Age Correlation in Married Couples, Bayesian Analysis Project</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Using age data from 100 sampled U.S. married couples, hypothesized a semi-conjugate prior, generated a predictive dataset to confirm the hypothesis, and used Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) approximation for mean ages and correlation coefficient</li>
            <li>Reduced age confidence interval by one year compared to traditional frequentist approach</li>
            <li>Reduced correlation coefficient confidence interval by 2% compared to traditional frequentist approach</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Country Needs Assessment for Humanitarian Aid, Data Science Foundations Project</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Utilized Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to reduce dimensionality</li>
            <li>Categorized countries using Partitioning and K-mean clustering with socio-economic and health factors that determine overall development</li>
            <li>Compiled a list of countries in Cluster 1, providing actionable insights to strategically focus resources on the most underserved populations</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Credit Risk Assessment Model, Data Science with Python Class Project</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Developed a logistic regression model to predict credit risk, achieving over 80% accuracy in predicting high-risk and low-risk individuals</li>
            <li>Conducted thorough analysis of key attributes such as age, job type, housing status, credit amount, and credit history to determine their influence on credit risk</li>
        </ul>
