                    <h3>Tuition Variation Model, Undergraduate Research Capstone</h3>
                    <p><strong>Project Summary:</strong> Developed a predictive model in R to analyze tuition rates for public and private universities in the U.S., utilizing various metrics to explain tuition variability.</p>
                    <p><strong>Technologies Used:</strong> R, Linear Regression, dplyr (for data wrangling), caret (for model training and selection), ggplot2 (for data visualization)</p>
                    <p><strong>Detailed Description:</strong></p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Problem Statement:</strong> Understanding the factors that influence tuition rates across different universities.</li>
                        <li><strong>Solution:</strong> Created a linear regression model to predict tuition variability.</li>
                        <li><strong>Process:</strong>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Collected data from three public datasets, focusing on 60 universities across the U.S.</li>
                                <li>Conducted data wrangling to clean and prepare datasets, including addressing missing values and ensuring appropriate variable encoding.</li>
                                <li>Explored institutional, quality of life, and crime metrics to understand their relationship with tuition rates.</li>
                                <li>Constructed a comprehensive linear regression model, performing model selection to identify the most significant predictors of tuition variability.</li>
                                <li>Validated its predictive capabilities using leave-one-out cross-validation (LOOCV).</li>
                                <li>Applied the model to analyze the University of Pittsburgh</li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                   <p><strong>Results and Impact:</strong> The model accounts for 85% of the variability in tuition rates, with university rank being a key factor driving these differences. This indicates that more prestigious institutions can command higher tuition fees. Notably, other commonly cited metrics, such as student-to-faculty ratios and graduation rates, did not significantly influence tuition predictions, suggesting that students are increasingly paying for prestige rather than institutional investment. The model's effectiveness in predicting tuition rates demonstrates its practical applicability, offering valuable insights for prospective students assessing their educational investments.</p>
                    <p><strong>Challenges Faced:</strong> Managed data quality issues during collection and cleaning.</p>
                    <p><strong>Future Improvements:</strong> Explore the inclusion of additional factors like financial aid offerings.</p>

                    <h3>Navigating Inflation: A Custom CPI Analysis for College Students, Course Research Capstone</h3>
                    <p><strong>Project Summary:</strong> Analyzed the Consumer Price Index (CPI) for college students, creating a custom CPI calculation based on essential products and services.</p>
                    <p><strong>Technologies Used:</strong> Python, pandas, numpy</p>
                    <p><strong>Detailed Description:</strong></p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Problem Statement:</strong> Traditional CPI does not accurately reflect college students' consumption patterns.</li>
                        <li><strong>Solution:</strong> Developed a custom CPI to better reflect the costs that impact students.</li>
                        <li><strong>Process:</strong>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Collected price data through API retrieval for essential products and services in three U.S. regions over a five-year period (January 2017 to January 2022).</li>
                                <li>Calculated weighted averages for each product category based on student consumption patterns.</li>
                                <li>Created functions to compute inflation rates and lag using the custom CPI, enabling analysis of price changes over time.</li>
                                <li>Conducted a comparative analysis to highlight significant trends in inflation affecting college students.</li>
                                <li>Developed visualizations to illustrate inflation rates of the custom CPI against the general CPI across different lag periods.</li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                    <p><strong>Results and Impact:</strong> Highlighted significant inflation trends affecting college students, particularly in essential categories.</p>
                    <p><strong>Challenges Faced:</strong> Encountered limitations with data availability for specific items.</p>
                    <p><strong>Future Improvements:</strong> Consider expanding the analysis to include more product categories and regions.</p>

                    <h3>Age Correlation in Married Couples, Bayesian Analysis Project</h3>
                    <p><strong>Project Summary:</strong> Analyzed the relationship between the ages of husbands and wives using data from 100 sampled U.S. married couples.</p>
                    <p><strong>Technologies Used:</strong> R, Bayesian Analysis, Stochastic Processes(MCMC), rstan (for Bayesian modeling)</p>
                    <p><strong>Detailed Description:</strong></p>
                    <ul>
                         <li><strong>Problem Statement:</strong> Due to limited data, traditional methods yielded wide confidence intervals, making it challenging to accurately understand age dynamics in marriages.</li>
                        <li><strong>Solution:</strong> Utilized Bayesian methods to analyze age correlation.</li>
                        <li><strong>Process:</strong>
                            <ul>
                                
                                <li>Hypothesized an Inverse Wishart distribution for variance and a Multivariate Normal distribution for the mean.<li>
                                <li>Generated predictive datasets through random sampling from hypothesized distributions, confirming a strong positive correlation between ages.</li>
                                <li>Confirmed our hypothesis by comparing predictive datasets through scatter plots to the original data, demonstrating that they exhibited the same relationship.<li>
                                <li>Employed Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods to estimate mean ages and the correlation coefficient.</li>
                                <li>Created confidence intervals for both estimates, demonstrating the advantages of Bayesian methods over traditional approaches.</li>
                                
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                    <p><strong>Results and Impact:</strong> The limited sample size and lack of prior information about the variables resulted in relatively wide confidence intervals using standard frequentist approaches. In contrast, the Bayesian method reduced the confidence interval for the average ages of husbands and wives by over a year, while the confidence interval for the correlation coefficient was narrowed by 2% compared to the frequentist method at the same alpha level. These findings underscore the advantages of Bayesian methods, particularly in providing narrower confidence intervals and more accurate estimations of correlations. By effectively leveraging prior information, the Bayesian approach significantly enhances the reliability of our analysis regarding age dynamics in marriages.</p>
                    <p><strong>Challenges Faced:</strong> Required a solid understanding of Bayesian statistics for accurate implementation.</p>
                    <p><strong>Future Improvements:</strong> Explore larger datasets for broader analysis.</p>

                    </ul>
                    <p><strong>Results and Impact:</strong> Identified 51 countries in Cluster 1 with urgent needs for intervention.</p>
                    <p><strong>Challenges Faced:</strong> Data availability and reliability were critical factors.</p>
