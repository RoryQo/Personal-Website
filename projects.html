                <h3>Tuition Variation Model, Undergraduate Research Capstone</h3>
                <p><strong>Project Summary:</strong> Developed a predictive model to analyze tuition rates for public and private four-year universities in the U.S.</p>
                <p><strong>Technologies Used:</strong> R, Linear Regression, Data Visualization, dplyr, ggplot2</p>
                <p><strong>Detailed Description:</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Problem Statement:</strong> Understanding the factors that contribute to variability in tuition rates across institutions.</li>
                    <li><strong>Solution:</strong> Created a model that accounts for various metrics influencing tuition variability.</li>
                    <li><strong>Process:</strong>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Collected data from three public datasets covering 60 observations from top U.S. universities.</li>
                            <li>Conducted thorough data wrangling to clean and prepare datasets, addressing missing values and ensuring appropriate variable encoding.</li>
                            <li>Constructed a comprehensive linear regression model, employing leave-one-out cross-validation (LOOCV) to validate predictive capabilities.</li>
                            <li>Applied the model to the University of Pittsburgh, revealing insights into out-of-state tuition rates.</li>
                            <li>Ensured robustness of the model by testing it across various subsets of data, confirming consistent performance and predictive accuracy.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p><strong>Results and Impact:</strong> The model achieved over 85% of variability in tuition rates accounted for, demonstrating its effectiveness in explaining tuition differences. National ranking was identified as the most significant predictor, illustrating that prestigious institutions leverage their rankings to justify higher tuition. The findings provided actionable insights for prospective students, helping them assess the potential return on investment for their educational choices. Furthermore, the model's robustness across various datasets supports its reliability in real-world applications, making it a valuable tool for students and policymakers alike.</p>
                <p><strong>Challenges Faced:</strong> Navigating the complexities of data collection and ensuring model robustness.</p>
                <p><strong>Future Improvements:</strong> Expand the dataset to include additional universities and factors.</p>

                <h3>Navigating Inflation: A Custom CPI Analysis for College Students, Course Research Capstone</h3>
                <p><strong>Project Summary:</strong> Analyzed the Consumer Price Index (CPI) specifically for college students.</p>
                <p><strong>Technologies Used:</strong> Python, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn</p>
                <p><strong>Detailed Description:</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Problem Statement:</strong> Assessing inflation rates that specifically affect college students.</li>
                    <li><strong>Solution:</strong> Developed a custom CPI calculation based on essential products and services.</li>
                    <li><strong>Process:</strong>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Collected price data through API retrieval for three regions (Northeast, Midwest, South) over five years.</li>
                            <li>Implemented functions to calculate inflation rates based on the custom CPI.</li>
                            <li>Conducted a comparative analysis highlighting trends in essential items like gas, recreation, and rent.</li>
                            <li>Created visualizations to emphasize the differences in CPI for students compared to the general population.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p><strong>Results and Impact:</strong> Highlighted significant inflation trends affecting college students, providing insights for financial planning.</p>
                <p><strong>Challenges Faced:</strong> Ensuring accurate data collection and analysis across regions.</p>
                <p><strong>Future Improvements:</strong> Incorporate real-time data for more dynamic assessments.</p>
