        <h2>PROJECTS</h2>
        <h3>Tuition Variation Model, Undergraduate Research Capstone</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Developed a predictive model in R to analyze tuition rates for public and private four-year universities in the U.S., utilizing institutional, quality of life, and crime metrics to explain tuition variability.</li>
            <li>Achieved over 85% of variability in tuition rates accounted for, with national ranking identified as the most significant predictor.</li>
            <li>Collected data from three public datasets encompassing 60 observations from top U.S. universities.</li>
            <li>Constructed a comprehensive linear regression model, employing leave-one-out cross-validation (LOOCV) to validate predictive capabilities.</li>
            <li>Conducted thorough data wrangling to clean and prepare datasets.</li>
            <li>Applied the model to the University of Pittsburgh, revealing that out-of-state students pay approximately $9,000 above expected tuition.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>CPI Mini Research Capstone</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Analyzed the Consumer Price Index (CPI) specifically for college students, resulting in a custom CPI calculation.</li>
            <li>Collected price data through API retrieval for three regions covering a five-year period.</li>
            <li>Implemented functions to calculate inflation rates based on the custom CPI.</li>
            <li>Conducted a comprehensive analysis highlighting that while the custom CPI is less robust than the general CPI, it captures inflation trends affecting college students.</li>
            <li>Developed a comparative graph visualizing inflation rates of the custom CPI against the general CPI.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Age Correlation in Married Couples, Bayesian Analysis Project</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Analyzed the relationship between the ages of husbands and wives using data from 100 sampled U.S. married couples.</li>
            <li>Generated predictive datasets through random sampling, confirming a strong positive correlation.</li>
            <li>Employed Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods to estimate mean ages and the correlation coefficient.</li>
            <li>Demonstrated that the Bayesian approach provided narrower confidence intervals for average ages.</li>
            <li>Utilized R for data analysis, focusing on visualizing relationships and employing statistical techniques.</li>
        </ul>
      
        <h3>Country Aid Mini Project</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Analyzed socio-economic and health indicators to categorize countries most in need of humanitarian assistance.</li>
            <li>Conducted a correlation analysis and utilized Principal Component Analysis (PCA).</li>
            <li>Determined three optimal clusters through clustering techniques.</li>
            <li>Identified Cluster 1, comprising 51 countries with the most critical needs.</li>
            <li>Created visualizations to compare key factors across clusters.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Credit Risk Assessment Model, Data Science Project</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Analyzed customer attributes to predict credit risk using logistic regression.</li>
            <li>Managed data preprocessing, handling missing values and converting categorical variables.</li>
            <li>Developed a comprehensive model achieving approximately 78% accuracy.</li>
            <li>Created visualizations to understand credit risk distributions and relationships among variables.</li>
            <li>Implemented a workflow in Python to conduct exploratory data analysis.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h3>Students' Adaptability to Online Learning, Data Science Project</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Investigated students' adaptability to online learning by applying data wrangling, visualization, and machine learning techniques.</li>
            <li>Achieved approximately 93% accuracy in predicting adaptability using advanced machine learning models.</li>
            <li>Identified significant factors influencing adaptability.</li>
            <li>Created insightful visualizations using Python libraries.</li>
            <li>Prepared data by encoding categorical variables and scaling features.</li>
        </ul>
