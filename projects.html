                    <h3>Tuition Variation Model, Undergraduate Research Capstone</h3>
                    <p><strong>Project Summary:</strong> Developed a predictive model in R to analyze tuition rates for public and private universities in the U.S., utilizing various metrics to explain tuition variability.</p>
                    <p><strong>Technologies Used:</strong> R, Linear Regression, dplyr, caret, ggplot2</p>
                    <p><strong>Detailed Description:</strong></p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Problem Statement:</strong> Understanding the factors that influence tuition rates across different universities.</li>
                        <li><strong>Solution:</strong> Created a linear regression model to predict tuition variability.</li>
                        <li><strong>Process:</strong>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Collected data from three public datasets, focusing on 60 universities across the U.S.</li>
                                <li>Conducted data wrangling to clean and prepare datasets, including addressing missing values and ensuring appropriate variable encoding.</li>
                                <li>Explored institutional, quality of life, and crime metrics to understand their relationship with tuition rates.</li>
                                <li>Constructed a comprehensive linear regression model</li>
                                <li>performed stepwise model selection to identify the most significant predictors of tuition variability.</li>
                                <li>Validated its predictive capabilities using leave-one-out cross-validation (LOOCV).</li>
                                <li>Applied the model to analyze the University of Pittsburgh</li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                   <p><strong>Results and Impact:</strong> The model accounts for 85% of the variability in tuition rates, with university rank being a key factor driving these differences. This indicates that more prestigious institutions can command higher tuition fees. Notably, other commonly cited metrics, such as student-to-faculty ratios and graduation rates, did not significantly influence tuition predictions, suggesting that students are increasingly paying for prestige rather than institutional investment. The model's effectiveness in predicting tuition rates demonstrates its practical applicability, offering valuable insights for prospective students assessing their educational investments.</p>
                    <p><strong>Challenges Faced:</strong> Managed data quality issues during collection and cleaning.</p>
                    <p><strong>Future Improvements:</strong> Explore the inclusion of additional factors like financial aid offerings.</p>

                    <h3>Navigating Inflation: A Custom CPI Analysis for College Students, Course Research Capstone</h3>
                    <p><strong>Project Summary:</strong> Analyzed the Consumer Price Index (CPI) for college students, creating a custom CPI calculation based<br>on essential products and services.</p>
                    <p><strong>Technologies Used:</strong> Python, API Data Retrieval, pandas, numpy</p>
                    <p><strong>Detailed Description:</strong></p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Problem Statement:</strong> Traditional CPI does not accurately reflect college students' consumption patterns.</li>
                        <li><strong>Solution:</strong> Developed a custom CPI to better reflect the costs that impact students.</li>
                        <li><strong>Process:</strong>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Collected price data through API retrieval for essential products and services in three U.S. regions over a five-year period<br>(January 2017 to January 2022).</li>
                                <li>Calculated weighted averages for each product category based on student consumption patterns.</li>
                                <li>Created functions to compute inflation rates and lag using the custom CPI, enabling analysis of price changes over time.</li>
                                <li>Conducted a comparative analysis to highlight significant trends in inflation affecting college students.</li>
                                <li>Developed visualizations to illustrate inflation rates of the custom CPI against the general CPI across different lag periods.</li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                    <p><strong>Results and Impact:</strong> Highlighted significant inflation trends affecting college students, particularly in essential categories.</p>
                    <p><strong>Challenges Faced:</strong> Encountered limitations with data availability for specific items.</p>
                    <p><strong>Future Improvements:</strong> Consider expanding the analysis to include more product categories and regions.</p>

                    <h3>Age Correlation in Married Couples, Bayesian Analysis Challenge</h3>
                    <p><strong>Project Summary:</strong> Utilized Bayesian methods to analyze the relationship between the ages of husbands and wives, from 100 <br>sampled U.S. married couples. This approach enhanced the usability of the analysis by providing more reliable estimates and narrower <br>confidence intervals, surpassing the limitations of traditional methods.</p>
                    <p><strong>Technologies Used:</strong> R, Bayesian Analysis, Stochastic Processes (MCMC), rstan (for Bayesian modeling)</p>
                    <p><strong>Detailed Description:</strong></p>
                    <ul>
                         <li><strong>Problem Statement:</strong> Due to limited data, traditional methods yielded wide confidence intervals, making it challenging <br>to accurately understand age dynamics in marriages.</li>
                        <li><strong>Solution:</strong> Utilized Bayesian methods to analyze age correlation.</li>
                        <li><strong>Process:</strong>
                            <ul>
                                
                                <li>Hypothesized an Inverse Wishart distribution for variance and a Multivariate Normal distribution for the mean.</li>
                                <li>Generated predictive datasets through random sampling from hypothesized distributions, confirming a strong positive <br>correlation between ages.</li>
                                <li>Confirmed our hypothesis by comparing predictive datasets through scatter plots to the original data, demonstrating that <br>they exhibited the same relationship.</li>
                                <li>Employed Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods to estimate mean ages and the correlation coefficient.</li>
                                <li>Created confidence intervals for both estimates, demonstrating the advantages of Bayesian methods over traditional approaches.</li>
                                
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                    <p><strong>Results and Impact:</strong> The limited sample size and lack of prior information about the variables resulted in relatively wide confidence intervals using <br>standard frequentist approaches. In contrast, the Bayesian method reduced the confidence interval for <br>the average ages of husbands and wives by over a year, while the confidence interval for the <br>correlation coefficient was narrowed by 2% compared to the frequentist method at the same alpha level. These findings <br>underscore the advantages of Bayesian methods, particularly in providing narrower confidence intervals and more <br>accurate estimations of correlations. By effectively leveraging prior information, <br>the Bayesian approach significantly enhances the reliability of our analysis regarding age dynamics in marriages.</p>
                    <p><strong>Challenges Faced:</strong> Required a solid understanding of Bayesian statistics for accurate implementation.</p>
                    <p><strong>Future Improvements:</strong> Explore larger datasets for broader analysis.</p>

                                <li>Cleaned and organized the dataset, rescaled support variables, and created income percentiles to define treatment and control groups.</li>
                                 <li>Applied Difference-in-Differences (DiD) regression to estimate the effect of PANES transfers on political support.</li>
                                 <li>Included squared income terms to account for potential nonlinear effects of income on political support.</li>
                                <li>Applied various bandwidths to ensure that the results were not sensitive to specific assumptions.</li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                    <p><strong>Results and Impact:</strong> Enabled early identification of high-risk customers, enhancing lending decisions.</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li> PANES transfers significantly increased political support, especially among lower-income households. The coefficient on the interaction term was positive and statistically significant, confirming the causal impact of transfers.</li>
                        <li>The effect of transfers was stronger for households with lower income, highlighting the moderating role of income on political support.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p><strong>Challenges Faced:</strong>  The scaling of political support variables differed from the paperâ€™s description but aligned with the results. </p>
                    <p><strong>Future Improvements:</strong> Consider exploring other policy programs and their long-term effects on political loyalty.</p>

        <h3>Effect of Seasonal Migration in Bangladesh, Research Reproduction</h3>
        <p><strong>Project Summary:</strong> Replicated Bryan et al. (2014) analysis on seasonal migration's impact on household consumption in rural Bangladesh.</p>
        <p><strong>Technologies Used:</strong> R, Regression Analysis, Instrumental Variables, Fixed Effects, dplyr, RCT</p>
        <p><strong>Detailed Description:</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Problem Statement:</strong> Investigate how seasonal migration subsidies impact household consumption during the lean season.</li>
            <li><strong>Solution:</strong> Replicated the randomized control trial (RCT) analysis using R to estimate treatment effects on migration and consumption, and apply an instrumental variable approach to isolate causal effects.</li>
            <li><strong>Process:</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>Loaded and merged data from two rounds of household surveys (pre- and post-treatment)</li>
                    <li>Conducted regression analysis to estimate the intention-to-treat (ITT) effects on baseline outcomes like savings and caloric intake</li>
                    <li>Performed first-stage regression to examine the impact of the treatment on migration</li>
                    <li>Estimated the effect of treatment on household consumption using a reduced form regression</li>
                    <li>Used an instrumental variable (IV) approach to estimate the Local Average Treatment Effect (LATE) of migration on consumption</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>Results and Impact:</strong> The LATE estimates revealed that migration induced by the treatment increased household consumption by approximately 374 takka, offering insights into the potential for migration subsidies to improve welfare in rural areas.</p>
        <p><strong>Challenges Faced:</strong> Addressed issues of endogeneity by using treatment as an instrument for migration.</p>

        <h3>The Effect of Health Risk on Housing Values: Evidence from a Cancer Cluster, Research Reproduction</h3>
        <p><strong>Project Summary:</strong> Reproduced the analysis from Lucas Davis' 2004 study on the impact of a cancer cluster in Churchill County on housing prices, using real estate data from Churchill and Lyon counties.</p>
        <p><strong>Technologies Used:</strong> R, Difference-in-Differences (DID), Inflation Adjustment, Event Study Analysis</p>
        <p><strong>Detailed Description:</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Problem Statement:</strong> Investigate how the cancer cluster in Churchill County affected housing values.</li>
            <li><strong>Solution:</strong> Reproduced Davis' Difference-in-Differences (DID) methodology to compare housing price changes in Churchill County (treatment group) to Lyon County (control group).</li>
            <li><strong>Process:</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>Wrangled housing sales data from both counties between 1995-2005</li>
                    <li>Applied inflation adjustments using the Nevada Home Price Index</li>
                    <li>Conducted an event study to analyze home prices before and after the 2000 cancer cluster event</li>
                    <li>Used regression models to estimate the causal impact of the cancer cluster on housing prices</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>Results and Impact:</strong> The analysis showed that housing prices in Churchill County dropped after the cancer cluster, with the DID approach indicating a significant price decrease compared to Lyon County (Control).</p>
        <p><strong>Challenges Faced:</strong> Merging data and adjusted for inflation using external indices.</p>

     <h3>Literature Review on the Economic Impact of Terrorism</h3>
    <p><strong>Project Summary:</strong> This review analyzes the economic effects of terrorism, focusing on its influence on business performance and GDP growth across various sectors and regions.</p>

    <p><strong>Key Findings:</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Economic Declines:</strong> Terrorism leads to significant decreases in revenues and GDP. For instance, Bayter (2021) reported a 2% to 4% annual revenue drop in France for three years post-attacks, while Abadie and Gardeazabal (2003) noted a 10% decline in GDP per capita in the Basque Country.</li>

        <li><strong>Perceived Risk and Relocation:</strong> Fear from terrorism can drive businesses to relocate, as seen after 9/11 in Chicago, where vacancies increased in prime office spaces.</li>

        <li><strong>Sector-Specific Impacts:</strong> The agricultural and manufacturing sectors are particularly vulnerable. Ali (2010) highlighted the decline in Pakistan's agriculture and the manufacturing sector's lowest growth in a decade due to terrorism-related disruptions.</li>

        <li><strong>Heterogeneous Effects:</strong> Transnational terrorism has a greater negative impact on economic growth in developing countries, emphasizing the complex nature of terrorism's economic effects.</li>
    </ul>

     <p><strong>Results and Impact:</strong>
    
        Terrorism disrupts business performance and economic growth, necessitating targeted policies to mitigate its impacts and protect economies. Understanding these relationships is vital for strategic planning and effective responses.
