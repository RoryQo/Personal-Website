                <h3>Tuition Variation Model, Undergraduate Research Capstone</h3>
                <p><strong>Project Summary:</strong> Developed a predictive model to analyze tuition rates for public and private four-year universities in the U.S.</p>
                <p><strong>Technologies Used:</strong> R, Linear Regression, Data Visualization, dplyr, ggplot2</p>
                <p><strong>Detailed Description:</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Problem Statement:</strong> Understanding the factors that contribute to variability in tuition rates across institutions.</li>
                    <li><strong>Solution:</strong> Created a model that accounts for various metrics influencing tuition variability.</li>
                    <li><strong>Process:</strong>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Collected data from three public datasets covering 60 observations from top U.S. universities.</li>
                            <li>Conducted thorough data wrangling to clean and prepare datasets, addressing missing values and ensuring appropriate variable encoding.</li>
                            <li>Constructed a comprehensive linear regression model, employing leave-one-out cross-validation (LOOCV) to validate predictive capabilities.</li>
                            <li>Applied the model to the University of Pittsburgh, revealing insights into out-of-state tuition rates.</li>
                            <li>Ensured robustness of the model by testing it across various subsets of data, confirming consistent performance and predictive accuracy.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p><strong>Results and Impact:</strong> 
                    The model achieved over 85% of variability in tuition rates accounted for, demonstrating its effectiveness in explaining tuition differences. 
                    National ranking was identified as the most significant predictor, illustrating that prestigious institutions leverage their rankings to justify higher tuition. 
                    The findings provided actionable insights for prospective students, helping them assess the potential return on investment for their educational choices. 
                    Furthermore, the model's robustness across various datasets supports its reliability in real-world applications, making it a valuable tool for students and policymakers alike.
                </p>
                <p><strong>Challenges Faced:</strong> Navigating the complexities of data collection and ensuring model robustness.</p>
                <p><strong>Future Improvements:</strong> Expand the dataset to include additional universities and factors.</p>

                <h3>Age Correlation in Married Couples, Bayesian Analysis Project</h3>
                <p><strong>Project Summary:</strong> Analyzed the relationship between the ages of husbands and wives using data from 100 sampled U.S. married couples.</p>
                <p><strong>Technologies Used:</strong> R, Bayesian Analysis, MCMC, ggplot2</p>
                <p><strong>Detailed Description:</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Problem Statement:</strong> Traditional methods offer wide confidence intervals due to limited data. By utilizing Bayesian methods, we aimed to reduce these intervals through the generation of additional predictive datasets.</li>
                    <li><strong>Solution:</strong> Employed Bayesian methods to analyze age correlation, providing more precise estimates.</li>
                    <li><strong>Process:</strong>

                            <li>Gathered data from a sample of 100 married couples, recording their ages.</li>
                            <li>Hypothesized distributions for the variance using the Inverse-Wishart distribution and for the mean using the Multivariate Normal distribution.</li>
                            <li>Generated predictive datasets through random sampling from established distributions, confirming our hypotheses as the scatter plots of the predictive datasets exhibited the same relationship between the variables as the original data.</li>
                            <li>Employed Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods to estimate mean ages and the correlation coefficient, creating new confidence intervals for both.</li>
                            <li>Demonstrated that the Bayesian approach provided narrower confidence intervals for average ages compared to frequentist methods, utilizing the additional data generated.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p><strong>Results and Impact:</strong> Demonstrated narrower confidence intervals using Bayesian methods, showcasing their effectiveness in data-scarce scenarios.</p>
                <p><strong>Challenges Faced:</strong> Required a solid understanding of Bayesian statistics for accurate implementation.</p>
                <p><strong>Future Improvements:</strong> Explore larger datasets for broader analysis.</p>
